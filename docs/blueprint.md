## Core Features:

- Library Scanning: A local agent scans the user's NAS for media files and extracts basic metadata.
- Metadata Enrichment: Enrich media metadata using the TMDB API to gather detailed information about movies and TV shows.
- Metadata Upload: Push enriched metadata to Firestore for the user's private library.
- Media Catalog Browsing: Browse your self-hosted library in a user-friendly interface, with details, summaries, and ratings.
- Search and Filter: Quickly find media in your catalog with advanced search and filter options (e.g., by title, genre, actor, year).
- Watchlist: Add movies and shows to a personal watchlist.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to evoke a sense of sophistication and cinematic immersion. This choice draws inspiration from the purple lighting commonly found in theaters, and movie posters.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#212121), almost black, to enhance contrast and focus attention on media content, conducive to dark-scheme viewing.
- Accent color: Electric violet (#8c52ff), a vivid, bright contrast to the deep purple, used to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, like play buttons.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif; Body font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif. This paring is great for legibility for our catalog-style app.
- Use a set of clear, minimalist icons to represent actions and categories within the library (e.g., play, watchlist, genre). Consistent iconography helps create an intuitive user experience.
- A grid-based layout to showcase media posters, with clear sectioning for browsing, search, and user settings.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement during navigation and content loading.
